# Modeling Time Series
This time I'll try to simple modeling of time series. First of all, let's descript our models:</br>
1. Polynomial model (special case is n = 2)
2. Hyperbolic model
3. Logarithmic model
</br>
# Polynomial model with n = 2
Imagine, that we have a function:</br>

Using least squares method, we have system of linear equations:</br>
